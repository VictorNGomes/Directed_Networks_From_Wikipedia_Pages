# Directed Networks From Wikipedia Pages

## About this project:
This project is part of the course [Algorithm and Data Structure 2](https://github.com/ivanovitchm/datastructure) from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte.
The objective of this work is to generate a network (graph) directed from the links of the Wikipedia pages and perform an analysis applying network concepts. To generate the network initially a Wikipedia page is provided, then the network depth level is limited to 2. Stable diffusion was the seed chosen to generate the network.

Stable Diffusion is a deep learning, text-to-image model released in 2022. It is primarily used to generate detailed images conditioned on text descriptions, though it can also be applied to other tasks such as inpainting, outpainting, and generating image-to-image translations guided by a text prompt.

### Metrics:
**Degree Centrality:** Degree centrality is the number of vertices connections 

**Closeness Centrality:** Average distance to all other vertices

**Betweenness Centrality:** Position on the shortest path

**Eigenvector Centrality:** Authority score based on the score of the neighbors
